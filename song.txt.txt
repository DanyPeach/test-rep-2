Rupaul, you wanna be fierce?
Take a look at this overness
La Toya J, you wanna be fire?
Touch some of this dynamite
We so bad, we so bold
We the maximum overload
(Voulez-vous, disco fierce)
Got me feeling all boogie nights


[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna do you wanna do you wanna do you wanna
Do you wanna do you wanna do do do
Do you wanna do you wanna do you wanna do you wanna
Do you wanna do you wanna do do do
Twerk, make my body jerk
Twirl, girl you better work
We the life of the party, girl
We the life of the party world

[Chorus]
I feel like dancing (Turn it up)
Got to keep on dancing (Turn it up)
And if I wanna stay and throw my life away (Oh oh oh)
'Til then I say, live for today (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 2]
Fellas, fellas, up in here
Step into my world full of atmosphere
I don't care what they say about me
Life with La Toya, that's who I'll be
Got a problem with all my cash

[Pre-Chorus]
Then tell 'em RuPaul
Y'all kiss kiss kiss
Then tell 'em RuPaul
Y'all kiss kiss kiss
Then tell 'em RuPaul
Y'all kiss kiss kiss
(Then tell 'em RuPaul)
(Y'all kiss kiss kiss)
(Then tell 'em RuPaul)
(Y'all kiss kiss kiss)
(Then tell 'em RuPaul)
(Y'all kiss kiss kiss)
(Then tell 'em RuPaul)
Y'all kiss my ass!
(One, two, three!)
I feel like dancing (Turn it up)
Got to keep on dancing (Turn it up)
And if I wanna stay and throw my life away (Oh oh oh)
'Til then I say, live for today (Oh oh oh)

[Breakdown]
I feel like dancing (Turn it up)
Got to keep on dancing (Turn it up)
And if I wanna stay and throw my life away (Oh oh oh)
'Til then I say (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
I feel like dancing (Turn it up)
Got to keep on dancing (Turn it up)
And if I wanna stay and throw my life away (Oh oh oh)
'Til then I say, live for today (Oh oh oh)
I feel like dancing (Turn it up)
(I said, I feel like dancing)
Got to keep on dancing (Turn it up)
(I said, I feel like dancing)
And if I wanna stay and throw my life away (Oh oh oh)
(I said, I feel like dancing)
'Til then I say, live for today (Oh oh oh)
(I said, I feel like dancing)
